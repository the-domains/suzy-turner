# Rocking the gypsy top

I've always loved the gypsy top but the ones I've tried on over the past few years have left me feeling a little uninspired until I found this one (in the sale earlier this year) from [Pull & Bear][0]. It literally cost me a few euros - a total bargain! I put it on for the first time the other evening and decided I didn't like the sleeves so I chopped them off! I think it's much better with a short sleeve. So what do you think? Am I rocking the gypsy top?

I'm also showing off (!) this gorgeous Vera Wang necklace which was a gift from a wonderful friend. I couldn't believe it when I opened it and saw this. Isn't it absolutely divine?

On this occasion, we were heading out with friends (we had a delicious Indian meal at the [Clay Pot ][1]restaurant in Albufeira) and I wanted a smart casual look.

I love these distressed skinny jeans that I bought from [Tiffosi ][2]last year, and I think they help to add a casual touch to the outfit. The shoes were from [Massimo Dutti ][3]and I've had them over a year. They go with so many things - I just love them! The gold leather clutch was also from Massimo Dutti in the sale a couple of weeks ago. I've had my eye on it for a while so was delighted to snap it up at a discount.

I__borrowed Michael's Ray Bans's to complete the look and I think it's quite fun! What do you think? Is the gypsy top a good fashion staple or do you dislike them?
